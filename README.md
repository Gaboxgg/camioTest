In the main root of the project we can found the MainActivity.

SDK info: minSdkVersion 22 targetSdkVersion 29

At repo you can find the key for sign apk (the key folder called key), I will send you the password of the key by email and 
u can find an apk to test the App in the folder "apk".

When u get the apk, u can run it in any Android Device (up to minSdkVersion) or you can use an emulator,
I used to do it with NOX (https://es.bignox.com/). Is easy to install, configure and use.

Inside the app u will find 4 sections:

-Popular (Popular movies)
-Top rated (Top rated movies)
-Upcoming (Upcoming movies)
-Favorite (Favorite movies)

Features:
-There is online and offline mode, but u only can use offline a section if u previously used that section online.
-Swipe down to refresh every section.
-Swipe left to add movie to favorite section or if u are in the favorite section swipe left to remove movie from favorite list.
-Click image to expand movie detail.
-Scroll text if u need it.

Let me know if u need help with anything, reply to my emial if u need it.
